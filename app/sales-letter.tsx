        We've created a strategy that filters out negative Google reviews.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's right... only good reviews go to Google. Bad reviews will not!{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        When someone finds your business on Google, my aim is for them to go
        "Wow this business looks great!"
        <br />
        <br />
        Google Ads can work wonders for your clinic and alot of people will see
        your clinic on Google, but if your reviews & ratings are bad, you don't
        want people to see your clinic yet, and hence spending on Google Ads now
        can be a waste of money. Focus on improving your online reputation
        (Google reviews & ratings) first, then it's worth it to boost your
        clinic with Google Ads.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we donâ€™t improve your reviews & ratings, you pay RM 0 and get all
        your money back. <br />
